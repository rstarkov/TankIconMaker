# EXAMPLES #
#
# Please read the warning at the top of the file and place your additions INTO A NEW FILE
# named "WotBuiltIn-2.csv"


# ussr-SomeTank,,,,,,del
#
# Hide SomeTank completely, regardless of game version. Use this to hide "weird" tanks
# not available in your region.


# ussr-SomeTank,ussr,8,medium,special
#
# This defines a new USSR tier VIII medium tank, one that isn't available for purchase.
# If the game data also defines a SomeTank, the properties specified above take precedence.


# ussr-SomeTank,ussr,8,medium,special,#0466
#
# Same as above, only this tank is only displayed for WoT versions 0.8.7 and higher.
# See a list of version numbers at the end of this file.
# If the game data also defines SomeTank, it will be visible, and the properties
# will depend on the game version.


# ussr-SomeTank,,9
#
# Change SomeTank to be tier 9 regardless of game version. Omitting country and type information
# tells TankIconMaker that these should be inherited from the game data and only the tier should
# be changed. If there is no such tank in the game data, a warning is generated and the tank is
# skipped.


# ussr-SomeTank,,9,,,#0466
#
# Change SomeTank to be tier 9 starting with WoT version 0.8.7


# ussr-SomeTank,ussr,8,medium,special,#0466
# ussr-SomeTank,ussr,8,medium,special,#0515,del
#
# Same as above, only this tank is only displayed for WoT version 0.8.7, and is removed
# from WoT versions 0.8.8 and higher. Note that the "del" line doesn't actually require
# the country etc and those fields are ignored. This is equivalent:
#
# ussr-SomeTank,ussr,8,medium,special,#0466
# ussr-SomeTank,,,,,#0515,del


# ADDITIONAL NOTES #

# Each line must be blank, start with a #, or list a tank.
#
# Available fields:
#  - tank ID: the name of the icon file and also equals country + "-" + internal WoT tank ID
#  - country: one of "china", "czech", "france", "germany", "italy", "japan", "poland", "sweden", "uk", "usa", "ussr", "none"
#  - tier/level: a number from 1-10, or 0 for "none"
#  - type: one of "light", "medium", "heavy", "artillery", "destroyer", "none"
#  - availability: one of "normal" (available for silver), "premium" (available for gold), "special" (not available)
#  - game version: #1234, the "#" is mandatory and the number MUST consist of 4 digits
#  - "del" marker: see examples above
#
# All fields except for the first one are optional.
#
# The order of lines does not matter.
#
# Tanks are read from the game data, then from WotBuiltIn-1.csv, then -2, if any, and so on.
# The WotBuiltIn-1 file takes precedence over the actual game data, -2 takes precedence over -1 etc.
